# ArduinoDM
A script for an Arduino and LED light strip to model the behaviour of a cryogenic dark matter detector.

Kit requires:

* An arduino board or similar
* An LED light strip compatible with the FastLED library (I used the WS2812B strip)
* Breadboard, wires and switches for control purposes
* Some creativity and crafts to make the resulting contraption a little more pretty

Code is in main.ino.
